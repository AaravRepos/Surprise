# Hello! This is a template for a surprise, on your own name..

### Mine is https://aaravsite.github.io/surprise
But as I have it here too, https://aaravrepos.github.io/surprise
or https://aaravrepos.github.io/surprise/index.html
#### Step 1. Make a new org, go to https://github.com/settings/organizations
The name of your new org, will be the name, like this, **aaravsite**.github.io/surprise
#### Step 2, Fork this repo here, https://github.com/AaravRepos/surprise/fork, and name it whatever you want.
It will be the name of your site too, like this. 
aaravsite.github.io/**surprise**
REMEMBER TO FORK IT UNDER YOUR NEW ORG!
#### Step 3, A github page should be automaticly made in this manner,
##### **OrgName**.gtihub.io/**RepoName**.
### IF NOT, MAKE ONE YOURSELF
IIt will take you to a rickroll!
